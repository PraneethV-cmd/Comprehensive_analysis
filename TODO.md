    NOTE: IN the fourth question we have to ensure these things: 

    TODO: 1. We have to detect whether there is a cycle in the graph
    TODO: 2. We have to see if the snake board is of the size n * n 
    TODO: 3. We have to find the and check if there is any intersection of snakes and the ladders
    TODO: 4. We have to find and check whether there is an actual path to BFS 
    TODO: 5. We have to check whether there is no direct path to the destination meaning there should be no ladder or snake from 1 to n*n
