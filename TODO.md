<!--
    NOTE: IN the fourth question we have to ensure these things: 

    TODO: 1. We have to detect whether there is a cycle in the graph
    TODO: 2. We have to see if the snake board is of the size n * n 
    TODO: 3. We have to find the and check if there is any intersection of snakes and the ladders
    TODO: 4. We have to find and check whether there is an actual path to BFS 
    TODO: 5. We have to check whether there is no direct path to the destination meaning there should be no ladder or snake from 1 to n*n 
-->

<!-- NOTE: TO sai krishna 

    -> complete adding proper coments to every single sorting algorithm. 
        Checked. But for every sorting code time complexity shows 0ms
    -> for every single sorting algorithm, make sure it works Checked
    
    -> for every single graph based question, add the following graph based random genearting code .


// THE RANDOM GENERATING CODE  

1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/test-case-generation-set-4-random-directed-undirected-weighted-and-unweighted-graphs/

Find which graph algorithm uses directed/undirected and weighted/unweighted graphs
and then use that.

-> Add random input case for the second question
-> and add comments for the second question as well
